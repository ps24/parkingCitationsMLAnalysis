# parkingCitationsMLAnalysis
Using data from Los Angeles Parking Citations (source:  Kaggle) for ML analysis

#  Files
There are three total files: 
*  two files dedicated to data cleaning (DataCleanUp.ipynb, DataCleanUp_2_Encoding)
*  one file dedicated to the machine learning algorithms and evaluation (MLproject.ipynb)

#  How to Run
* **To access data files,** use Google's Colab notebooks and log in with a google CSUF account. Only CSUF google users are 
permitted to access these data files.  If you are a non-CSUF google user, please reach out to me 
directly and I will email you the files.

* **Environment:** It is recommended that you run the .ipynb files on Google Colab or Jupyter.  

**Steps:**

1.  Open a Google Colab notebook

2.  Open 'MLproject.ipynb' in Google Colab notebook and select 'Runtime' --> 'Run All'

3.  Authenticate Google Account for GDrive access to the data files.

4.  Wait 5 minutes for data load and machine learning algorithms to run.

5.  Input street name and hour to predict the risk of recieving a parking citation in Los Angeles.
